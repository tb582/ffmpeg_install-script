# ffmpeg_install-script

We'll work through the official FFMPEG Compilation https://trac.ffmpeg.org/wiki/CompilationGuide/Centos to build the required components to install and run FFMPEG in Centos7!

# Install
```wget https://github.com/tb582/ffmpeg_install-script/blob/master/ffmpeg.sh
chmod +x ffmpeg.sh
./ffmepg.sh```
